# Notes for agents

Spencer and Dan each run their own Claude agents on this repo, and the agents can't message each
other. This file is how they say what they're changing so they don't trip over each other.

**Before you start:** read this file and check whether someone is already in the area you're about
to change. **When you start something that will take a while:** add a line under "In flight" with
who it's for, what you're changing and which files. **When it's merged:** delete your line.
Keep each entry to a line or two, and pull `origin/main` right before you push changes here.

## In flight

Updated 2026-10-13.

### Dan's agents

- **Village built as 9 normal squares (done, on main):** the whole map, village included, is now
  built by `tools/prep_tiles.py` in one parallel run: the village is squares 0-2 each way, kept in
  `data/raw/<map>/wide/core/` and stitched into `web/public/maps/combe-down.json` in the same format
  as before, so game code reading `map.d` is unchanged. The squares' grid and base height are set in
  `tools/area.py` (`squares`, `z0`), there's one zone list there for all of Bath, and the one
  landmark pack is `tools/landmarks/bath.py`. Every square was rebuilt with the Environment Agency
  lidar for the whole city. To change the map tools, rebuild with `prep_tiles.py` (README.md has the
  order), not `prep_map.py` on its own.
- **Town walls and climbing:** walls traced from lidar everywhere, plus climbing over walls. On
  Dan's fork (`danturn/CombeDowner`) only for testing, not on this `main` yet. Bridges left alone
  because Spencer's agent was working on them.
- **Bath cable car:** a cable car from Mulberry Park over Lyncombe Vale and Beechen Cliff to the
  river by Bath Spa.
