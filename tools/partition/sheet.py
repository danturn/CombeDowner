"""The ground as one sheet (`gs` in a square's file): the open ground meets the street, pavement and
path faces at their edges, instead of being drawn under them and let down out of sight.

The game draws `gs` unless `?ground=old` (web/src/world.ts), its open ground triangulated round the
faces (web/src/sheet.ts buildSheetCdt; `Land` here fills cell by cell, as `?ground=sheet` does, and
tools/check_more.py swaps in the game's triangles); a square without it draws the ground as before,
from the grid and the faces (`sf`), which `gs` leaves as they are. docs/plans/ground-architecture.md, sections 4.2 to 4.7, is the design; what was built
differently from it, and why, is written up there under stage 3.

What the sheet is made of:
  - the faces (`sf`), drawn at their written heights: streets level across, pavements a kerb up,
    paths level across and following the hill along their length;
  - the railway's bed (`sf` "bed"), drawn as ballast just over the line's own ballast, where the line
    runs on the ground, up to its tunnels' mouths: the ground meets it like any other face;
  - the ground grid (`t`), drawn as it is, in every cell no face touches (with the hill the game
    raises over the canal's tunnels, `tunnel_hills`, which the sheet's moves are measured from);
  - in a cell a face's edge passes through, the ground is only what lies outside the faces, and it
    meets each face's edge at the face's own drawn height, so nothing of the ground is drawn under a
    face and no edge stands off the ground;
  - beside each face the ground is carved down or built up to meet it, no steeper than 1 in 1.5 cut
    or 1 in 2 filled, within BATTER_MOST of its edge; where meeting the face would take a wider bank
    than that (or than the bank down from a house standing above it), a low retaining wall stands
    at the face's edge for what is left over, in the
    square's own wall material (at a cliff's top, down to the cliff's foot). A flight of steps is
    sunk into the hill: the hill beside it is held up to SUNK_MOST over it by such a wall, and a
    wall within NARROW of the railway's bed below it goes down to the bed's level. A grid
    point is never built up more than FILL_MOST over the survey, nor at all within a cell and a half
    of the water or a bridge's deck, and is kept DECK_UNDER under a deck's underside, out to its
    abutments, where a face ending under the deck's end is held by a wall as an abutment.

What is baked here (`gs`), all as whole numbers so it packs small:
  n   the version of these rules;
  c   the grid cells under faces: run lengths over the cells in rows (south to north, west to
      east), starting with a run of cells that are not. A cell no free edge crosses is wholly under
      faces and draws no ground; of the cells one crosses, it marks those whose south-west corner
      is under a face;
  h   the grid points carved or built up, as steps from the point before, and hz how far each moves,
      in decimetres (the grid's own unit);
  s   the face corners where the ground meets a face's edge lower or higher than its top (a
      retaining wall), as steps from the corner before, and sz the ground's height there from the
      face's top, in centimetres;
  w   the wall the square's retaining walls are built as (its most common kind of wall);
  x   the cells where faces overlap (a free edge with another face on its open-ground side), as
      steps from the cell before: each is drawn whole as the grid, its corners let down under the
      faces in it, rather than cut (drawn as nothing, the part of it no face covers was a hole).

What is not baked, because shipping it would cost more than the 5% of a square's download the sheet
may add (measured: the ground's own triangles in the cells faces cross came to about 12%): which
triangles join those points. The game cuts each such cell along the faces' free edges and fills what
is left (web/src/sheet.ts `buildSheet`), and `Land` below does the same for the checks. Both read only what
is here and in `sf`, so they agree with each other and with every load.

Nothing here is decided over the network: it is all build-time.
