// Traffic lights that work, British style: red, red and amber together, green, amber, red. The map
// has them from OpenStreetMap (each square's `cx`: a crossing with lights, p, or lights at a junction,
// s, on a street running at some angle), and furniture.ts draws them, with their lamps lit by this
// sequence; the traffic stops for them (traffic.ts).
//
// - At a junction, the lights within a few dozen metres of each other are one set: those on streets
//   running one way go green while those running across them are red, and the other way about.
// - At a crossing on its own, it's green for the traffic most of the time, red for a little while for
//   anyone crossing.
// Each set starts its cycle at its own moment, worked out from where it is, and it all runs off the
// clock, so everyone sees the same lights at the same time and nothing goes over the network.
